"According to the FAQ database, when using waitress to serve the app.py for making predictions, you should modify your scripts to avoid pickle errors by:

Put the class into a separate module and import it in both the script that saves the model (e.g. train.py) and the script that loads the model (e.g. predict.py)

This is because pickle will reference the class in the global namespace (`__main__` module) when saving the model, but waitress will load the predict App module and pickle will try to find `__main__.<custom_class>` which does not exist.","When running a docker container with waitress serving the app.py for making predictions, pickle will throw an error that can't get attribute <name_of_class> on module __main__.
This does not happen when Flask is used directly, i.e. not through waitress.
The problem is that the model uses a custom column transformer class, and when the model was saved, it was saved from the __main__ module (e.g. python train.py). Pickle will reference the class in the global namespace (top-level code): __main__.<custom_class>.
When using waitress, waitress will load the predict_app module and this will call pickle.load, that will try to find __main__.<custom_class> that does not exist.
Solution:
Put the class into a separate module and import it in both the script that saves the model (e.g. train.py) and the script that loads the model (e.g. predict.py)
Note: If Flask is used (no waitress) in predict.py, and predict.py has the definition of the class, When  it is run: python predict.py, it will work because the class is in the same namespace as the one used when the model was saved (__main__).

The answer is not explicitly stated in the context. However, it is mentioned in section 5. Deploying Machine Learning Models, that there are issues with pip version due to version conflicts. In particular, user Bhaskar Sarma mentions that there can be issues when different versions of Scikit-Learn are used for training and deployment. This could be a possible cause of the pip version error.

Additionally, section 5. Deploying Machine Learning Models, user Gopakumar Gopinathan mentions that HOMEWORK asks to install Scikit-Learn version 1.3.1. This could also be a cause of the pip version error if the correct version is not installed.

There are other errors mentioned in the context, such as user Odimegwu David mentioning that running ""pipenv install scikit-learn==1.0.2"" gives errors, and user Alejandro Aponte mentioning that running ""pipenv install"" gives a resolution failure.

"According to the context from the FAQ database, the algorithms that represent bagging and boosting in this course are:

* Bagging: Random Forest
* Boosting: XGBoost","For ensemble algorithms, during the week 6, one bagging algorithm and one boosting algorithm were presented: Random Forest and XGBoost, respectively.
Random Forest trains several models in parallel. The output can be, for example, the average value of all the outputs of each model. This is called bagging.
XGBoost trains several models sequentially: the previous model error is used to train the following model. Weights are used to ponderate the models such as the best models have higher weights and are therefore favored for the final output. This method is called boosting.
Note that boosting is not necessarily better than bagging.
MÃ©lanie Fouesnard
Bagging stands for âBootstrap Aggregationâ - it involves taking multiple samples with replacement to derive multiple training datasets from the original training dataset (bootstrapping), training a classifier (e.g. decision trees or stumps for Random Forests) on each such training dataset, and then combining the the predictions (aggregation) to obtain the final prediction. For classification, predictions are combined via voting; for regression, via averaging. Bagging can be done in parallel, since the various classifiers are independent. Bagging decreases variance (but not bias) and is robust against overfitting.
Boosting, on the other hand, is sequential - each model learns from the mistakes of its predecessor. Observations are given different weights - observations/samples misclassified by the previous classifier are given a higher weight, and this process is continued until a stopping condition is reached (e.g. max. No. of models is reached, or error is acceptably small, etc.). Boosting reduces bias & is generally more accurate than bagging, but can be prone to overfitting.

"Based on the provided CONTEXT, here's the answer to the QUESTION:

""How can I verify the results of my own code for evaluation metrics?""

You can verify the results of your own code for evaluation metrics by using scikit-learn's off-the-shelf calculations. Specifically, you can use the `accuracy_score`, `precision_score`, `recall_score`, `f1_score`, and `roc_auc_score` functions to compute your model's evaluation metrics. This approach saves time and provides more precise results compared to calculating these metrics from scratch using NumPy and Pandas libraries.

As an example, you can use the following code:
```python
from sklearn.metrics import (accuracy_score,
                            precision_score,
                            recall_score,
                            f1_score,
                            roc_auc_score
)

accuracy = accuracy_score(y_val, y_pred)
precision = precision_score(y_val, y_pred)
recall = recall_score(y_val, y_pred)
f1 = f1_score(y_val, y_pred)
roc_auc = roc_auc_score(y_val, y_pred)

"ANSWER:

According to the context, the application of regularization techniques depends on the specific situation and problem. It is recommended to consider it when training machine learning models, especially with small datasets or complex models, to prevent overfitting. However, its necessity varies depending on the data quality and size. Evaluate each case individually to determine if it is needed.

In this case, the question asks whether we need to always use regularization techniques in machine learning. The answer is no, we don't always need to use regularization techniques. We should consider the specific situation and problem, and evaluate each case individually to determine if it is needed.","The application of regularization depends on the specific situation and problem.

"Based on the provided context, here is the answer to the QUESTION:

""How can I solve the issue of running out of storage after building many docker images?""

**Solution:** 
To solve the issue of running out of storage after building many docker images, you need to remove unused docker images and then run `docker system prune` to free up the space. 

Additionally, for future reference, it is recommended to use the `--rm` flag when running containers to automatically remove them after they are no longer needed.","Problem description

"Based on the provided context, the QUESTION is: ""In which order are folders read when determining numeric class labels in flow_from_directory in TensorFlow?""

The ANSWER can be found in the section 8. Neural Networks and Deep Learning, question ""How are numeric class labels determined in flow_from_directory using binary class mode and what is meant by the single probability predicted by a binary Keras model?""

The answer is: Folders will be read in alphabetical order. For example, in the case of a folder named ""dino"", and another named ""dragon"", ""dino"" will read first and will have class label 0, whereas ""dragon"" will be read in next and will have class label 1.","The command to read folders in the dataset in the tensorflow source code is:
for subdir in sorted(os.listdir(directory)):
â¦
Reference: https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/keras/preprocessing/image.py, line 563
This means folders will be read in alphabetical order. For example, in the case of a folder named dino, and another named dragon, dino will read first and will have class label 0, whereas dragon will be read in next and will have class label 1.
When a Keras model predicts binary labels, it will only return one value, and this is the probability of class 1 in case of sigmoid activation function in the last dense layer with 2 neurons. The probability of class 0 can be found out by:
prob(class(0)) = 1- prob(class(1))
In case of using from_logits to get results, you will get two values for each of the labels.
A prediction of 0.8 is saying the probability that the image has class label 1 (in this case dragon), is 0.8, and conversely we can infer the probability that the image has class label 0 is 0.2.

"Based on the provided FAQs from the ""Machine Learning Zoomcamp"" course, specifically from section 4. Evaluation Metrics for Classification, here is the answer to the question:

""Why does a threshold of 1.0 result in FPR being 0.0?""

The answer is that when the threshold is 1.0, the condition for belonging to the positive class (churn class) is g(x) >= 1.0. Since the sigmoid function g(x) can never equal 1.0 exactly, there is no object (or instance) for which the churn-condition could be satisfied. As a result, there are no positive (churn) predicted values (neither true positive nor false positive) when the threshold is equal to 1.0. Therefore, the FPR is 0.0.","For churn/not churn predictions, I need help to interpret the following scenario please, what is happening when:
The threshold is 1.0
FPR is 0.0
And TPR is 0.0
When the threshold is 1.0, the condition for belonging to the positive class (churn class) is g(x)>=1.0 But g(x) is a sigmoid function for a binary classification problem. It has values between 0 and 1. This function  never becomes equal to outermost values, i.e. 0 and 1.
That is why there is no object, for which churn-condition could be satisfied. And that is why there is no any positive  (churn) predicted value (neither true positive, nor false positive), if threshold is equal to 1.0
